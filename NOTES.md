# Phase 0: Baseline agent (CLI-driven loop)

## Architecture
A Python script calls `claude -p` in a loop (subprocess). It decides on its own
whether to continue or stop, based on the actual pytest output.

## Evidence (real run)
Attempt 1: deliberately given a contradictory instruction (is_prime(1) = True).
The test failed: assert True is False, where True = is_prime(1)
The agent read this output itself, generated a prompt containing the error
text, and rewrote solution.py.
Attempt 2: 31 passed. The agent stopped on its own.

## Conclusion
The "run → check → fix based on the real error" loop works without human
involvement. Baseline for comparison with Phase 5 (evidence-based
stop conditions with more complex tasks and attempt history).
